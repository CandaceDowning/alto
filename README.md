# Candace Downing's Submission for Alto

## Purpose
A front end code exercise to be submitted for interview process. 

## General Notes

### Successes

- Set up react routing to make it easier to navigate views. I saw the icon for the navigation, so I maybe did more than neccessary.

- Used React Styled components and set up a small theme.

### Issues
- Updated the mission.json file to pull images from the public folder for easier access.

- Chose not to use the logo asset for the navigation header because it was too grainy. However, I couldnt find a matching font, so I ended up going with the Optimal Medium since the 'A' matched the best, but there was no option that had an offset thiness to the 'O'.

- Had some difficulty guessing layouts since the designs were not inspectable.

- More colors and fonts given than needed, so used best judgement.

## Style Guide
Created to assist in development, and used the disabled appearance navigation item as the link. It is still styled as a disabled element, but will link. 

## To Run Project
- Clone from repo.
- Navigate to the root file 'alto'.
- Use command ### `npm start` to run project.
- A browser window will open at localhost:3000, and you will see the style guide view first.
- If in mobile view, the navigation bubbles at the right will take you to the four views, which are orderd by name on the mock ups.
- In in desktop view, the navigation items at the top will take you to the four views, and are text based.
